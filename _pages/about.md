I'm a third year Ph.D student from School of Mathematics and Information Science, Guangzhou University. My research interest includes applied cryptography, blockchain, information security.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chunming Tang](https://maths.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1073/1828.htm) from the School of Mathematics and Information Science, Guangzhou University.
I am now a visiting Ph.D. student at Singapore University of Technology and Design, advised by Asst. Prof. [Zehui Xiong](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/zehui-xiong) since 2023.09.
